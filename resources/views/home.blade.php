                                <h4>Who Can Use This System?</h4>
                                All active members of the ASW are eligible to use this Membership Roster program as a resource to contact
                                other members in their coven and throughout the organization.  In addition, the ASW leadership and coven scribes
                                have the ability edit some or all of the member's records as follows:<br/><br/>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Coven Leaders (HPS, HP, and Acting) and Scribes:</strong> Abilty to add new members to their own coven.  Access to other member records is read-only.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Elders:</strong> Administrator-level access: May edit any member's record.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Guild Leaders:</strong> May add or remove guild members to their guild</li>
                                </ul>

                                <strong>NOTE:</strong> This resource is available to all members of the ASW. If your coveners wish to have
                                access, they will need to register using the email address that is associated with their
                                profile in this system.  If they attempt to register and are told that their email is invalid,
                                please check to see that the email listed in the system is correct, and change if necessary.

                                <h4>What is the Missing Data List?</h4>
                                The <a href="/member/missing">Missing Data</a> list is a breakdown by coven of several categories of information
                                that may be missing or incorrect.  If you are a coven leader or scribe, please check this list and correct all
                                relavant information. You should also be alert for the presence of people who are no longer coven members, or
                                those who are missing from the Roster.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <strong>NOTE:</strong> If a member has moved to a different coven, only a leader or scribe of the original coven
                                can change the member to the new coven.  After that point, only the leader or scribe of the new coven can make
                                changes to that member's record.
